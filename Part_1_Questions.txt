** (a) Data Heterogeneity:**

Unstructured: The news article descriptions and content from 
NewsAPI are raw text, requiring NLP techniques to process.

Semi-Structured: The NewsAPI response itself and the Google Trends output (when saved) 
are in JSON format, containing nested key-value pairs.

Structured: The Kaggle dataset and our final processed outputs are in CSV format, with 
clearly defined rows and columns (e.g., Job Title, Salary, Company Location).

** (b) Extraction Challenges:**

Rate Limiting: Both NewsAPI (free tier) and Google Trends (pytrends) have strict limits 
on the number of requests per hour.

Authentication: Managing environment variables for the NewsAPI key and Kaggle JSON token to 
ensure security.

** (c) Storage Justification:**

JSON is valuable for the initial extraction because it preserves the original hierarchy of 
the data, which is essential for "unstructured" text sources like NewsAPI.

CSV is chosen for the processed layer because it is highly efficient for the tabular analysis 
and visualization you will perform in Part 2 using Pandas.
