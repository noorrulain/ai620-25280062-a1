(a) Cleaning Rationale:

Missing Data: "For the Job Market dataset, I chose to drop rows where the salary_in_usd was 
missing. Imputing (guessing) salaries with a mean/median would introduce bias and inaccuracy for a financial analysis."

Duplicates: "I utilized drop_duplicates() to ensure that the frequency analysis (e.g., 'Most 
Common Job Titles') was not skewed by reposted job listings."

Time Series: "For the Google Trends data, I used ffill() (forward fill) for any small gaps, as 
search interest trends are continuous and unlikely to drop to zero instantly."

(b) Visualization Insights:

Temporal: "Search interest for 'Generative AI' shows a sharp exponential spike starting in late 
2022 (likely correlated with the release of ChatGPT), whereas 'Data Science' remains stable."

Categorical: "The job market is dominated by 'Data Engineer' and 'Data Scientist' roles, 
suggesting that foundational data infrastructure is still the primary hiring need over niche 
AI research roles."

Relationship: "There is a clear positive correlation between Experience Level and Salary, with 
Executive (EX) roles showing significantly higher variance (wider box plots) than Entry-level (EN) 
roles."

(c) Visualization Critique:

Limitation: "The 'Salary by Experience' box plot assumes all currencies were converted correctly 
to USD. If the conversion rate fluctuated during the data collection period (2020-2026), the 
outliers might be currency artifacts rather than real salary anomalies."

Improvement: "For a business stakeholder, I would add a 'Cost of Living' adjustment layer to 
the salary visualization to show purchasing power rather than raw dollars."
